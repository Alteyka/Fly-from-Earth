# Fly-from-Earth

Simple project about how would fly from earth.
Realised classic components of typical django project:
Some "one-to-one" models;
Class based Views (CBV) with using decorators which forbid display the content.
From the box system of login and registration.
And finally a few front end components with using Bootstrap.
